# Custom Debian Installer

Custom debian installer with ZFS support and some advanced network
configuration capabilities.

Mainly written for my personal use, but I don't see any reason not to
make it public.

One thing to keep in mind: There is basically no input validation. Your
entries might get written to config files or used in shell commands without
any sanity check.
